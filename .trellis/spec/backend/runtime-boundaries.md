# Runtime and Layer Boundaries

This contract describes the current runtime. The repository has one canonical
Core history and one JSONL session writer. The legacy project Memory, Dream,
and Learning object graphs are removed; this document must not describe
replacement objects or adapters for them.

## Physical layers

The package is split into physical boundaries visible in the directory tree:

- **Kernel** — `core/`, `context/`, `tooling/`, `providers/`, `session_runtime/`,
  `permission_state.py`, `usage.py`.  Kernel is independently understandable and
  never imports the Agent Runtime, Composition, or Application.
- **Agent Runtime** — `runtime/` owns the single-session Agent lifecycle through
  four owners plus state owners: `agent.py` (AgentRuntime — operation
  orchestration only), `conversation.py` (ConversationRuntime — AgentHarness,
  canonical active messages, live provider/model, run capture, retired provider
  close), `session.py` (SessionRuntime — session identity, repository, recorder
  lifecycle, provider configuration-entry port), `context.py` (ContextRuntime —
  context manager/compactor, model limits cache, compaction state),
  `execution.py` (ExecutionControl), `session_identity.py`
  (SessionIdentityState), and `provider.py` (ProviderController /
  ProviderState).  The Runtime may use Kernel, Context and Tooling, but never
  Composition or Application.
- **Capability** — `capabilities/`, including the cohesive `agent_state/`,
  `git_status/`, `plan/`, `skill/`, and `subagent/` feature packages.
  Capabilities never import the Agent engine or Application.
- **Composition** — `composition/` and `meta_agent.py`; the Composition Root
  knows the Agent Runtime and wires the graph.
- **Supervisor** — `supervisor.py`, consuming only the public Agent event /
  result / session contracts.
- **Interfaces** — package root public API, `__main__.py`, `adapters/`,
  `application/`, `server/`, and `sidecar.py`. Product-specific frontend delegation lives in
  `CodingSessionBackendAdapter`; `MetaAgent` remains feature-neutral.

`AgentHarness` at `core/harness.py` is a Kernel stateful-loop wrapper; it is not
the Agent Runtime.

## Composition root

The composition inputs are three orthogonal axes:

- `Profile` — WHAT TO BUILD: an immutable composition preset (caller tools,
  system prompt, `extension_specs`). It never carries config, bindings,
  provider, repository, backend, or presentation callbacks.
- `AgentConfig` — HOW IT RUNS: a frozen value object of user-visible runtime
  settings only; it holds no mutable runtime objects.
- `RuntimeBindings` — WITH WHAT: concrete implementation bindings grouped by
  responsibility (`ProviderBindings`, `SessionBindings`, `ToolBindings`,
  `InteractionBindings`). It is wiring, not a runtime-state owner.

`build_agent_composition(profile, config=config, bindings=bindings)` is the
one-shot Composition Root and the only place where the three axes meet. It
creates state owners, Provider and permission ports, tools, ContextManager,
selected capabilities, the four Runtime owners, and the ProviderController —
in one topologically sorted pass with no deferred post-construction binding.
Before Runtime construction it creates a `ProviderConfigurationProjection`,
which exposes only provider-read data to Runtime and Capability closures:

```text
foundation → ProviderConfigurationProjection → ContextRuntime
          → ConversationRuntime → SessionRuntime → AgentRuntime
          → ProviderController
```

`ProviderController` remains the sole provider-configuration write owner. After
each successful state transition it synchronizes the projection's reference to
the same authoritative `ProviderState`; the projection never stores a
controller reference and Runtime never reaches back to the controller.

`AgentComposition` is the one-shot layered graph; it does not retain the
profile, config, or bindings, and never returns a flat bag of everything:

```text
AgentComposition
├── runtime         agent / conversation / session / context /
│                   provider_controller / usage / budget
├── capabilities    registry / runtime / agent_state / git_status /
│                   plan / skill / subagent
├── tooling         registry / runtime / context / permission_policy /
│                   prompt_composer
└── interaction     notices / confirmation / status_sink
```

`build_profile_agent(profile, config=config, bindings=bindings)`
wraps every selected graph in the same feature-neutral `MetaAgent`.
`CodingSessionBackendAdapter` adds FullProfile product operations through
composition and delegation; it is not a `MetaAgent` subtype. No facade retains
a builder, CapabilityRegistry, project-Memory repository, or legacy command
delegate.

Profiles select the graph:

- `MinimalProfile`: MetaAgent, caller tools, neutral prompt, and an empty
  CapabilityRegistry unless caller extension_specs are supplied.
- `CodingProfile`: MetaAgent plus Coding tools and Coding Harness policy,
  AgentState/GitStatus ContextLayers, and supplied extension specs.
- `FullProfile`: Coding tools plus AgentState/GitStatus, Plan/SubAgent/default
  Skill, the capability-owned Semantic Memory capability (explicit tools plus
  an ordinary ContextLayer for reviewed pinned entries, backed lazily by
  `~/.lion-code/memory.sqlite3`), and supplied extension specs. A same-name
  `extension_specs` entry removes or replaces the built-in Semantic Memory
  selection. Everything stays behind MetaAgent.

The default dynamic prompt tail (`build_dynamic_system_context`) appends
root-to-cwd project instructions (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md plus local `.claude/rules`,
via `load_project_context_files`/`load_claude_md`) after the environment and Git
sections: same-directory AGENTS.md follows CLAUDE.md, subdirectories follow
parents, blank files are skipped. Instructions are additive only — they never
replace the static template or user/developer instructions and never enter
canonical session history. A Profile with a custom `system_prompt` keeps the
existing replacement semantics: no dynamic tail and no project instructions.

`command_backend` is a `ToolBindings` entry (defaulting to the local backend);
confirm callbacks, renderer factories, and print callbacks are
`InteractionBindings` entries. Neither pollutes any Profile.

No profile creates a Dream, Learning, Null, Deprecated, Legacy, or fallback
object. The Semantic Memory store is created by the Composition Root inside
the capability branch for FullProfile only; Profiles never carry store,
repository, or provider objects.

## State ownership

Every mutable runtime state has one owner. Consumers receive views and send
commands through narrow ports:

- `SessionIdentityState` owns the session id and start time.
- `ExecutionControl` owns cancellation transitions.
- `PermissionController` owns permission mode and confirmations.
- `ProviderController` owns provider configuration and thinking state; its
  commands ConversationRuntime (`replace_provider` / `set_model` /
  `retire_provider`), ContextRuntime (`replace_context_compactor` /
  `invalidate_model_limit_cache`), and SessionRuntime
  (`record_configuration_change`). It is never referenced by AgentRuntime in
  either direction.
- `ProviderConfigurationProjection` is the read-only provider boundary for
  Runtime and Capability callbacks. It exposes API readiness and child-agent
  provider kwargs, points at the authoritative `ProviderState`, and is
  synchronized only after a successful ProviderController transition. It owns
  no provider mutation or persistence state.
- `UsageLedger` and `BudgetPolicy` own usage and budget decisions.
- `PlanRuntime` owns Plan state.
- `SessionRuntime` owns session lifecycle and the recorder; `SessionRepository`
  replays JSONL and `SessionRecorder` appends events. Provider configuration
  changes are recorded through the SessionRuntime recorder port. `SessionRecorder`
  initializes lazily: a brand-new session writes no JSONL until its first
  `record_message`; only explicit retention paths (legacy migration) force
  on-disk metadata via `ensure_on_disk`.
- `ContextRuntime` owns the context manager, the provider-derived compactor,
  the model-limits cache, `effective_window`, and all compaction decision
  state (compaction flag, in-flight compaction task).
- `ContextManager` owns only the generic prepared-context projection. It
  receives structural ContextLayer callbacks from Composition, builds a frozen
  ContextView from canonical messages, and appends one prepared-only state
  message after budget/snipping/clearing/protected-window projection.
- `ConversationRuntime` owns the AgentHarness, the canonical active messages,
  the live provider/model, run output capture, and retired-provider close.
- `AgentRuntime` owns run orchestration order and stop-reason projection only;
  it holds no provider, context, or session mutable state.

Runtime must not query `ProviderController` for the current model, provider,
or context limits: live model/provider come from ConversationRuntime and
limits from ContextRuntime. Provider, context, scheduler, and configuration
recording ownership is wired directly during composition; deferred binding
ports are not part of the runtime graph.

Observers and frontends must not cache writable mirrors or access Core/Harness
containers directly.

## Canonical session and context path

```text
Core messages/events
  -> SessionRuntime (recorder ownership)
  -> SessionRecorder -> JsonlSessionStorage -> <session-id>.jsonl
  -> SessionRuntime.load -> immutable SessionRestoreState
  -> facade: ProviderController.restore_configuration + AgentRuntime.restore
  -> ContextRuntime.prepare/compact -> Provider request
```

`AgentRuntime` operations compose the owners in a fixed order, e.g. chat:
`SessionRuntime.ensure_ready` (after `ConversationRuntime.flush` and
`ContextRuntime.resolve_model_limits`) → `ContextRuntime` compaction decision
→ `ConversationRuntime.prompt` → stop-reason projection. Session restore is
the explicit facade orchestration above; SessionRuntime never calls back into
the ProviderController.

`new_session` always starts with clean canonical history. Cross-session task
continuity comes from the project Task Ledger and an explicit `recall_tasks`
tool call; Session compaction summaries are never copied into a new Session or
stored as project Memory. There is no handoff command, branch-summary entry, or
second session-transition path.

`lion_code/core/session/memory.py` remains the JSONL compaction-entry module.
Its name is historical session terminology, not a project Memory subsystem.
Canonical history, restore, compaction, legacy JSON read-only migration, and
Event Stream behavior remain in scope and must keep their tests.

## Provider readiness projection contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger

This contract applies when Runtime, Application, REST status, or the Desktop
Renderer needs to answer whether the active Provider can be used for a request.
The readiness answer must have one Runtime-owned formula and one stable wire
reason; consumers must not independently recompute it from credentials or URLs.

### 2. Signatures

```python
ProviderReadinessBlockerCode = Literal["provider_configuration_required"]

@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class ProviderReadiness:
    ready: bool
    blocker_code: ProviderReadinessBlockerCode | None

class ProviderConfigurationProjection:
    def readiness(self) -> ProviderReadiness: ...

class ProviderController:
    @property
    def provider_readiness(self) -> ProviderReadiness: ...

GET /api/status -> {
    "api_configured": bool,
    "provider_blocker_code": "provider_configuration_required" | null,
}
```

`ProviderConfigurationProjection.readiness()` is the only readiness formula.
`ProviderController.api_configured`, `RuntimeIdentityPort.api_configured`,
`MetaAgent.api_configured`, `LionCodingSession.api_configured`, and the REST
status value all derive from its `ready` value. Application ports expose the
same pair structurally as `provider_readiness.ready` and
`provider_readiness.blocker_code`.

### 3. Contracts

- `ready=true` always serializes with `provider_blocker_code=null`.
- `ready=false` always serializes with
  `provider_blocker_code="provider_configuration_required"`.
- Anthropic requires a non-empty API key; OpenAI-compatible requires a
  non-empty API key and a truthy base URL. An injected concrete Provider is
  considered usable even when its configuration fields are empty.
- A successful `ProviderController` transition synchronizes the existing
  projection state; a failed Provider construction or replacement leaves the
  prior state and readiness unchanged.
- The readiness code is intentionally one coarse configuration blocker. It
  does not classify model, network, workspace, capability, or health state.
- The Desktop `ServerStatus` decoder accepts only the two consistent pairs and
  rejects a missing, unknown, or inconsistent blocker code as a protocol
  error.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Injected concrete Provider with empty credential fields | `ready=true`, blocker `null`; the Provider may run |
| Anthropic with a non-empty API key | `ready=true`, blocker `null` |
| OpenAI-compatible with key and non-empty base URL | `ready=true`, blocker `null` |
| Missing key, or OpenAI-compatible missing/empty base URL | `ready=false`, blocker `provider_configuration_required` |
| Provider factory/replace transition fails | Preserve the old Provider, state, and readiness |
| Blocked Agent chat | Emit the existing canonical assistant error and make no Provider request |
| REST status pair is inconsistent | Never emit it; derive both values from one readiness snapshot |
| Desktop status field missing, unknown, or mismatched with `api_configured` | Reject at the decoder with an explicit metadata/protocol error |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: read one `ProviderReadiness` snapshot and project `ready` plus
  `blocker_code` to every consumer and the `/api/status` response.
- Base: keep the legacy `api_configured` boolean as a derived compatibility
  property while callers migrate to the structured projection.
- Bad: add a second `bool(api_key and base_url)` formula in Application,
  Server, or Desktop, or expand this code into a four-state health catalog.

### 6. Tests Required

- `tests/test_provider_controller.py`: readiness truth table, immutable
  snapshots, injected-provider readiness, empty OpenAI base handling, and
  failed-transition rollback.
- `tests/integration/test_meta_agent.py` and Runtime tests: public projection
  shape, concrete-provider execution, and blocked-chat no-request/error
  behavior.
- `tests/server/test_server_api.py`: `/api/status` ready/null and
  blocked/code pairs from the same session snapshot.
- `desktop/tests/renderer/assistantRuntime.test.ts`: strict decoder accepts
  only both valid pairs and rejects missing, unknown, or mismatched codes;
  `WorkspaceShell` and E2E fixtures include the required field.
- `python -m compileall -q lion_code tests`, Desktop typecheck, affected
  Desktop tests/E2E, and `git diff --check` remain required after edits.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```python
status = {
    "api_configured": bool(state.api_key and state.openai_base_url),
    "provider_blocker_code": None,
}
```

Correct:

```python
readiness = session.provider_readiness
status = {
    "api_configured": readiness.ready,
    "provider_blocker_code": readiness.blocker_code,
}
```

## Goal-aware structured compaction

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Automatic compaction at the 85% context threshold, manual compaction, and
context-overflow recovery all use the same provider-neutral compaction contract.
The change affects only the summary input and prompt; ContextPolicy thresholds,
projection protection, canonical history, and append-only session recording stay
unchanged.

### 2. Signatures

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class CompactionRequest:
    history_projection: str
    objective: str | None
    recent_context_hint: str
    input_budget_tokens: int

class ContextCompactor(Protocol):
    async def summarize(self, request: CompactionRequest) -> str: ...
```

`ContextRuntime.summarize(history, *, recent_context=(), objective=None)` builds
the request immediately before scheduling the existing compaction task. It does
not persist the request or create a second history owner.

### 3. Contracts

- `history_projection` is a deterministic role-delimited projection of the old
  canonical prefix. If it does not fit, only this projection is head/tail
  cropped; canonical messages and JSONL entries are never modified.
- The complete provider input is bounded by
  `int(effective_window_tokens * ContextPolicy.auto_compact_ratio)`. The
  estimator includes the system prompt and serialized compaction message, so
  `estimated(system + message) <= input_budget_tokens` before provider dispatch.
- `objective` and `recent_context_hint` each receive at most 5% of the total
  compaction input budget. The hint contains only the latest assistant
  conclusion, at most three unique failed tool names, and at most three recent
  file paths; the retained message suffix is never serialized in full.
- A non-empty current user objective has priority, followed by the latest user
  message in recent/history. ContextRuntime and the compaction contract do not
  know or hold PlanRuntime or any Plan-specific view.
- When no objective can be established, `objective` remains `None` and the
  prompt renders `[objective unavailable; do not invent a goal]`.
- The single `COMPACTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` requires these headings in order:
  `# Objective`, `# Constraints`, `# Decisions`, `# Repository State`,
  `# Findings`, `# Failed Attempts`, `# Completed Work`, `# Remaining Work`,
  `# Verification`. Every Findings and Verification item must include a
  `Coding Evidence` line with a source, command/result, commit, or one-line
  error reference.
- A returned summary is valid only when all nine headings are present exactly
  once and in the required order. Validation happens before SessionRuntime can
  append a `CompactionEntry`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Objective and user fallback are unavailable | Keep request objective `None`; render the explicit unavailable marker |
| Provider emits an error or empty summary | Preserve the existing compaction error; write no new entry |
| Summary misses, duplicates, or reorders a heading | Raise `InvalidCompactionSummary`; write no new entry |
| Fixed prompt exceeds the total input budget | Fail before provider dispatch |
| History exceeds its remaining budget | Crop only the provider history projection with a deterministic omission marker |
| Compaction is cancelled | Preserve the existing aborted event/cancellation path; write no new entry |
| Projection budgets or snips tool results | Change only provider projection; canonical history remains intact |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: ContextRuntime derives one bounded immutable request from canonical
  messages; SessionRuntime records only a validated returned summary in the
  existing CompactionEntry.
- Base: Manual or overflow compaction omits an explicit current objective and
  resolves the latest user message from its existing canonical context.
- Bad: Add a compatibility `summarize(messages)` overload, store a second
  history/Memory object, pass the full retained suffix into the compaction
  prompt, or inject PlanRuntime through a structural Protocol.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit tests assert the whole-request budget invariant, deterministic history
  cropping, 5% objective/hint limits, objective precedence, unavailable marker,
  and fixed summary headings.
- Runtime/integration tests assert the retained suffix becomes only a bounded
  hint, 85%-triggered compaction still appends a valid CompactionEntry, invalid
  summaries append no entry, and canonical messages are unchanged.
- Context projection tests assert the recent three eligible tool results and
  each file's last `read_file` remain protected at the existing thresholds.
- Provider error, empty-summary, and cancellation tests retain their existing
  error/event behavior.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```python
await compactor.summarize(messages)
```

Correct:

```python
request = CompactionRequest(
    history_projection=bounded_old_history,
    objective=resolved_objective,
    recent_context_hint=bounded_hint,
    input_budget_tokens=compaction_input_budget,
)
await compactor.summarize(request)
```

## Ephemeral prepared-context contract

ContextManager.prepare() is the only generic path that renders
CapabilitySpec.context_layer values. It passes each layer an immutable
ContextView containing current time, last-provider token utilization and
compaction status, the top three tool totals plus an aggregate remainder, the
latest three calls, the top three repeated calls, and at most three one-line
failures. GitStatusLayer renders the dirty-file count, at most three paths, and
an omitted count. Layer output size therefore stays constant as history and the
dirty-file set grow. Layers are sorted by layer_id; non-empty fragments are
wrapped into one role=user message at the prepared-context tail.

The Semantic Memory layer uses this ordinary path to read reviewed pinned
entries only. It performs a local synchronous SQLite read, retains at most
eight whole entries within 512 estimated tokens, skips an oversized entry so
later small entries can still fit, and returns an empty string when nothing is
eligible. It does not inspect the latest user query, call the Provider, write
canonical messages or session JSONL, or mutate the store. The database remains
unopened until this render or a Memory tool performs the first operation.

The state message is request-local:

| Consumer | May receive the state message? |
| --- | --- |
| Provider request from prepare_context | Yes, exactly once at the tail |
| Harness canonical messages | No |
| SessionRecorder / JSONL | No |
| CompactionEntry | No |
| ContextCompactor.summarize input | No |

The callback passed by Composition captures the completed immutable layer
tuple, not CapabilityRegistry, so the ContextRuntime path does not create a
reverse mutable-owner edge. Feature layers may read an existing owner (for
example PlanRuntime) but must not create counters, failure stores, or history.

## Application and frontend ports

`lion_code.application.ports` owns the protocol consumed by
`LionCodingSession`. The application owns event bridging, settled-event timing,
session commands, provider settings, and the one-at-most-one context-overflow
compact/retry policy. The Agent Runtime owns primitive prompt, continuation,
cancellation, and compaction operations.

The active slash surface contains session/history, provider, Plan, cost,
compaction, thinking, quit, and Skill commands. Former project-state and
memory-specific command paths are absent. Unknown commands retain the generic
unknown-command behavior.

The CLI and desktop frontends import application contracts only. The REPL may
render terminal output but must not own session persistence or a second command
dispatcher.

## Desktop sidecar access boundary

### 1. Scope / Trigger

This contract applies to the API-only FastAPI process managed by Electron Main.
It keeps a loopback desktop control plane without adding account, TLS,
reverse-proxy, static-site, or persistent-token state to Application or Runtime.

### 2. Signatures

```python
def create_app(
    session: LionCodingSession,
    *,
    capability: str,
    port: int = 8000,
) -> FastAPI: ...

GET /api/config/provider -> ProviderConfigResponse
POST /api/config/provider <- ProviderConfigRequest

```

The CLI has no Web startup flags. Electron starts `lion-code-sidecar` with a
workspace and receives the endpoint through the strict stdout ready record. The
Renderer transport contract is:

```text
REST: Authorization: Bearer <token>
WebSocket protocols: lion-code, lion-code-capability.<token>
```

### 3. Contracts

- The sidecar binds only `127.0.0.1` on an OS-selected port. Production Host
  must equal that loopback host/port; allowed Origins are the fixed desktop
  `lion://app` Origin and the development Vite loopback Origin.
- The sidecar generates one in-memory capability per process and returns it only
  in the stdout ready record consumed by Electron Main. It is never placed in
  argv, a URL, storage, ordinary logs, or negotiated back as the selected
  WebSocket subprotocol.
- Only `/api/health` is public. Status, messages, sessions,
  provider/model settings, skills, thinking, and Agent controls require the
  capability. FastAPI OpenAPI/docs routes remain disabled.
- `GET /api/config/provider` reads the ProviderController snapshot through the
  application session port. It is the only settings readback path for the API key;
  `/api/status`, session history, ordinary logs, and error details do not contain the
  credential. Renderer settings mask the returned key by default and reveal it only by
  an explicit local UI action. This does not change the existing disk persistence policy.
- An OpenAI Provider remains OpenAI-compatible when its saved custom base URL is empty:
  configuration resolution supplies `https://api.openai.com/v1` before sidecar
  composition, rather than inferring Provider kind from whether a URL happens to exist.
- REST validates Host, any supplied Origin, and Bearer capability at the Server
  entry point. WebSocket validates Host, required Origin, and both offered
  subprotocol values before `accept()` and before binding interaction callbacks.
- After transport validation, an app-scoped identity lease is acquired before
  `accept()` and callback binding. A second connection closes with 1008 without
  changing the first connection's callbacks; only the matching owner may release
  the lease.
- Browser actions are one strict, alias-only Pydantic discriminated union with
  `extra="forbid"`. Snake-case fields, coercions such as `"false"`, unknown
  actions, invalid approval choices, and extra fields emit `protocol_error` and
  do not resolve a pending interaction future.
- The accepted bridge exclusively owns pending confirmation/Plan futures, the
  active run task, and notice tasks. Cancel denies pending interactions before
  cancelling the Session. Disconnect performs deny -> Session cancel -> collect
  run/notice tasks -> unbind, and the close operation is idempotent.
- Server events serialize only canonical camelCase Application/Core models. The
  Renderer decodes `unknown` once at the protocol boundary before reduction; it
  has no snake-case fallback. Tool results join by `toolCallId`, terminal errors
  stop streaming, and final assistant messages replace provisional content.
- Every successful socket open reloads `/api/messages`; only the latest history
  request may replace state, and replacement discards all provisional transcript
  and approval state. The Web layer does not retain an event replay buffer.
- Input maps `/continue` and `/compact` to their typed actions and other slash
  text to `command`. Plan mode uses that command path. `steer` and `follow_up`
  remain typed senders without adding a second queue UI.
- Server authentication remains interface-owned. `LionCodingSession`, Core,
  Runtime, session JSONL, and provider state do not retain the capability.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Missing or incorrect REST Bearer capability | HTTP 401 without echoing either token |
| Foreign Origin or non-loopback Host on protected REST | HTTP 403 before session access |
| Foreign CORS preflight | No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` grant |
| Missing/incorrect WS token, missing/foreign Origin, or wrong Host | Close 1008 before accept/callback binding |
| A valid second WS connection while one owner is active | Close 1008; preserve the first callback owner |
| Invalid/coerced/snake-case WS action | Emit `protocol_error`; leave pending futures unresolved |
| Cancel while approval is pending | Deny the approval, cancel the Session, and leave no hidden future |
| WS disconnect during a run or notice send | Collect all bridge-owned tasks, unbind callbacks, then release the lease |
| Malformed or snake-case server event in the Renderer | Reject at the decoder and expose a terminal protocol error |
| Reconnect history responses complete out of order | Apply only the newest canonical `/api/messages` response |
| GET `/api/config/provider` succeeds | Return the canonical Provider/model/base URL/key snapshot without adding it to status or history |
| GET `/api/config/provider` is missing capability or malformed at Renderer | Reject the request/response and show a metadata diagnostic; never keep settings in a pending state |
| Invalid capability passed to `create_app` | `ValueError` before route construction |
| GET `/` | HTTP 404; the API app never mounts static content |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: Electron Main receives the ready record, checks the child identity, and
  passes the endpoint once through the typed Preload bridge; authenticated REST
  and WebSocket calls then succeed from `lion://app`.
- Base: the development Renderer reaches the same API from the fixed Vite
  Origin; no static content is served by Python.
- Bad: restore `allow_origins=["*"]`, accept a WebSocket before validation, add
  a CLI Web entry, place the token in a URL/storage, or cache it in
  Application/Runtime/session persistence.

### 6. Tests Required

- `tests/server/test_server_api.py` asserts the REST/CORS/WS Host-Origin-token
  matrix, pre-accept WS denial, disabled docs, and API-only root.
- `tests/test_cli.py` rejects the removed `--web`, `--port`, and `--no-browser`
  options and keeps them absent from help.
- Desktop tests assert in-memory endpoint delivery, Bearer injection, and the
  two WebSocket subprotocol values. TypeScript build covers all transport call
  sites.
- Bridge tests assert alias-only strict actions, approval cancellation, duplicate
  prompt rejection, second-owner rejection/release, idempotent disconnect, and a
  run waiting behind a blocked notice send. Compact success notices come from the
  Session owner and must not be duplicated by the bridge.
- Server tests assert protected Provider configuration readback, save-then-read
  round trips, and the absence of the key from status. A real Electron/sidecar
  preview test asserts the missing-API assistant error reaches the UI and clears
  streaming, then verifies settings survive sidecar restart.
- Desktop protocol tests assert canonical camelCase decoding, parallel tool
  correlation/result text/error state, terminal provider/server/protocol errors,
  final-message reconciliation, latest-request reconnect replacement, and typed
  Plan/continue/compact/steer/follow-up actions.
- Server tests must mock config persistence; the real user API configuration
  file must remain byte-for-byte unchanged.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```python
app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=["*"])
await websocket.accept()
```

Correct:

```python
if not trusted_host_origin or not valid_capability:
    await websocket.close(code=1008)
    return
await websocket.accept(subprotocol="lion-code")
```

## Product adapter contract (PR4)

### 1. Scope / Trigger

This contract applies when a product frontend needs FullProfile operations that
are not part of the generic Agent facade. The frontend boundary is
`CodingSessionBackend`; product behavior stays in
`CodingSessionBackendAdapter`, while generic conversation and runtime behavior
stays in `MetaAgent`.

### 2. Signatures

The public construction seams are:

```python
build_profile_agent(
    profile: Profile,
    *,
    config: AgentConfig,
    bindings: RuntimeBindings,
) -> MetaAgent

build_full_coding_backend(
    *,
    permission_mode: PermissionMode = "default",
    model: str = "claude-opus-4-6",
    session_repository: SessionRepository | None = None,
    tool_registry: ToolRegistry | None = None,
    ...,
) -> CodingSessionBackendAdapter
```

The Full product bootstrap lives in
`lion_code/composition/full_product.py`. This is the intentional product-facing
Composition boundary that assembles `MetaAgent` and the Adapter; the core
Composition modules remain independent of the facade. The Adapter module only
defines `CodingSessionBackendAdapter` and does not become a second Composition
Root.

`CodingSessionBackendAdapter` structurally implements `CodingSessionBackend`
and receives a `MetaAgent`, `PlanRuntime`, interaction controllers, and the
session repository it delegates to.

### 3. Contracts

- `build_profile_agent` returns the same `MetaAgent` facade shape for Minimal,
  Coding, and Full profiles.
- `build_full_coding_backend` in `composition/full_product.py` constructs
  `FullProfile → AgentComposition → MetaAgent → CodingSessionBackendAdapter`
  by reusing `build_agent_composition`.
- Generic methods (`prompt`, `continue_`, `steer`, `follow_up`, cancellation,
  compaction, provider views, and usage) delegate to `MetaAgent`.
- Product methods (session enumeration/legacy migration, Plan approval,
  terminal output, notices, confirmation, and cost presentation) are owned by
  the adapter and its injected controllers.
- `MetaAgent` must not expose product-specific methods or import adapters.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Minimal/Coding/Full profile construction | Exact `MetaAgent` result with the same Runtime owner tuple |
| Full product construction | `CodingSessionBackendAdapter` satisfying `CodingSessionBackend` |
| Adapter used as a `MetaAgent` subtype | Forbidden by MRO/architecture tests |
| Product method added to `MetaAgent` | Forbidden by the MetaAgent surface guard |
| Old `lion_code.agent` or root feature module imported | Forbidden by residual and architecture guards |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: use `build_profile_agent` for generic runtime consumers and
  `composition.full_product.build_full_coding_backend` for the application
  product path.
- Base: pass injected repository, registry, and confirmation callbacks through
  the factory so the adapter delegates to the same composition graph.
- Bad: subclass `MetaAgent`, copy product methods into it, or add a compatibility
  alias for a removed root module.

### 6. Tests Required

- `tests/architecture/test_product_adapter.py`: public `Agent` removal, adapter
  protocol/MRO, generic SPI isolation, feature tree, and profile runtime shape.
- `tests/adapters/test_coding_session_backend.py`: delegation, legacy session
  migration, callbacks, terminal output, and cost projection.
- `tests/integration/test_meta_agent.py`: exact feature-neutral MetaAgent
  surface, including generic queue/compaction/provider projections.
- `tests/architecture/_boundaries.py` and import-linter: adapter direction and
  Supervisor isolation.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```python
class CodingSessionBackendAdapter(MetaAgent):
    # Product methods become part of every generic Agent facade.
    ...
```

Correct:

```python
class CodingSessionBackendAdapter:
    def __init__(self, *, agent: MetaAgent, ...):
        self._agent = agent
```

Composition is the extension seam: generic profiles remain interchangeable and
the product adapter can be removed without changing Runtime ownership.

## Retained runtime seams

- `CapabilityRegistry`, `CapabilityRuntime`, `Plan`, `Skill`, and `SubAgent`.
- The public `AgentEvent`, result and session-reference contract consumed by
  `supervisor.py`.
- Provider replacement, usage recording, permission confirmation, ContextManager
  preparation, ContextCompactor summaries, and Core Event Stream.

These are narrow ports, not compatibility aliases. `Supervisor` must not import
Agent/Harness implementations or hold a second session-history writer. Its
checkpoint contains execution-control fields only and is separate from the
canonical session JSONL path.

## Verification obligations

Architecture tests must assert that removed production modules and exact legacy
symbols are absent. A current-architecture manifest keeps the specifically
removed Memory Capability symbols at zero; the enduring legacy scanner still
allows a future Capability-owned Memory implementation and
`core/session/memory.py`, without permitting the old ports, modules or coupling
to return. Import-direction contracts live in `tests/architecture/_boundaries.py`
and the import-linter config in `pyproject.toml`; they keep Kernel independent
of the Agent Runtime (`runtime/`) and keep Runtime free of Composition/Application
dependencies. `tests/architecture/test_runtime_ownership.py` additionally proves
the PR3 object graph: AgentRuntime and ProviderController never reference each
other, the Deferred wiring symbols stay deleted, each Runtime owner's mutable
state stays single-owner, a ContextLayer callback does not reverse-link
ContextRuntime to CapabilityRegistry, and the runtime package keeps no
Application imports. Run focused composition, Capability, context, session,
provider, application, and Runtime tests before the full suite, then run
compile, import linting, residual scans, and the repository quality gates.
