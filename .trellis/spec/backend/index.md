# Backend Development Guidelines

> Current Lion Code runtime development conventions. These files describe the

## How to Use These Guidelines

When updating a guideline file:

1. Document your project's **actual conventions** (not ideals)
2. Include **code examples** from your codebase
3. List **forbidden patterns** and why
4. Add **common mistakes** your team has made

The goal is to help AI assistants and new team members understand how YOUR project works.

**Language**: All documentation should be written in **English**.
(`four-layer-ownership.md` is the current exception — written in Chinese per the PR0
task requirement; its structure mirrors the English contract docs.)
