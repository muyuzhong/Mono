# Agent E2E Evaluation Boundaries

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract when adding a coding-Agent evaluation task, changing an
evaluation manifest/result schema, wiring an Agent worker, or implementing a
container backend. It also applies when adding a historical-replay task card or
changing corpus admission evidence, or adding a SWE-bench-Live external anchor. The evaluation system is a separate orchestration boundary:
it reuses `Agent.run()` and typed Core events but must not create a second Agent
history, session writer, provider path, or stdout-log parser.

The current `benchmarks/agent_e2e/` foundation is deliberately offline-only.
It contains a backend protocol and test fakes, not a Docker scheduler or a real
provider invocation. A host process or a Git worktree alone is never an official
evaluation isolation boundary.

The CLI is `python -m benchmarks.agent_e2e`. `validate` validates a public
catalog/lock pair, `offline-run` writes blocked evidence, and `online-run`
returns exit code `2` with a JSON `blocked` status until a real backend exists.

## 3. Contracts

- Every persisted evaluation model carries `schema_version="agent-e2e/v1"`,
  rejects unknown top-level fields, and permits future additions only under its
  explicit `extensions` field. Credentials, session keys, cookies, and tokens
  are forbidden in `extensions`.
- Freeze tasks with `CatalogLock` before execution. `ExperimentManifest` must
  repeat the profile fingerprint, code SHA, seed, repeat count, timeout, and
  budget exactly; a selected task must belong to the lock.
- An evaluation worker must call `Agent.run()`, subscribe through
  `agent.core_runtime`, and construct `SessionRepository` under a path outside
  the Agent workspace.
- `IsolationReport.official_safe` requires workspaces that do not overlap in
  either direction and `private_assets_visible_to_agent=False`. Equal or nested
  Agent/verifier paths are unsafe because the Agent could read verifier files.
- Historical-replay tasks must give the Agent only the selected public card and
  a base-tree snapshot. Do not mount the evaluator repository, a full catalog,
  or a `.git` object database that contains the gold commit; a normal worktree
  from the source repository leaks future history even when verifier files are
  elsewhere.
- The V1 Lion historical corpus has exactly 30 active cards: ten
  `cross_file_refactor`, ten `bugfix`, and ten `feature`; its split is 18
  regression / 12 holdout. Public cards contain the base revision and gold patch
  SHA-256 only. `PrivateEvidence.gold_revision` and provenance details remain on
  the evaluator side and must agree with the public hash.
- The V2 corpus keeps the same 30-card / 10-10-10 / 18-12 contract. It retires
  cards whose referenced modules were deleted (Dream/Memory/Learning/MCP and
  legacy terminal UI, PR9/PR7b) instead of mutating their v1 SHA-pinned records in
  place; rewrites surviving cards to currently existing paths when the original
  test file was renamed; and backfills four `cross_file_refactor` cards from the
  real Git history (#48/#52/#55/#57) using single-commit base/gold pairs whose
  REG and HOLDOUT commit sets do not intersect. Since v2, `validate_active_resources_exist`
  rejects ACTIVE cards whose involved files or validation paths are missing from
  the current worktree; v1 assets stay frozen as historical records.
- Historical `base=fail` / `gold=pass` is provenance language: the base tree
  differs from the gold tree and the Git binary diff is clean, hash-matched, and
  stable for exactly three repeats. It is not a semantic hidden-test pass and
  cannot yield an official score.
- The V1 external anchor is a committed, Python-only `SWE-bench-Live/SWE-bench-Live`
  `verified` manifest at one dataset revision and one evaluator revision. It has exactly 20
  IDs: five per `difficulty.files` stratum (1, 2, 3--4, 5+) and no repeated repository.
  The Agent never receives its gold patch, test patch, full dataset, evaluator checkout, or
  output directory.
- Official SWE-bench-Live scoring starts with exactly three official `gold` evaluator runs
  per frozen instance. An instance enters this machine's denominator only when all three
  records are completed and `resolved=true`. A gold failure, missing report, image failure,
  or runner error is excluded/invalid infrastructure evidence, never a model failure.
- `SubprocessOfficialSWEbenchLiveRunner` must call the frozen official entrypoint on Linux
  with only frozen IDs and a host-controlled result directory. Because the official evaluator has
  no dataset-revision argument, it must receive a host-materialized local JSONL of exactly the
  frozen 20 full rows. Its canonical selected-row SHA-256 must match the manifest before every
  run; passing the mutable Hugging Face dataset name directly is forbidden. `UnavailableOfficialSWEbenchLiveRunner`
  and test fakes may prove lifecycle behavior only; they cannot create an external score.
- A completed external report has an `ExternalAnchorEnvironment` containing the manifest,
  dataset revision/file SHA, evaluator revision, platform, and a resolved image digest for
  every denominator instance. If any digest is unavailable, the report is invalid and has no
  `success_rate`.
- Compare external success rates only after exact environment-fingerprint equality. Calibration
  requires at least five unique frozen profiles: one baseline, at least three candidates, and
  one deliberately degraded profile; it accepts external validity only at Spearman rho >= .70
  and pairwise direction agreement >= 80%.
- `evaluate_regression_gate` compares only two complete official reports with the same frozen
  catalog ID/version/SHA/task IDs, seed, repeats, timeout, budget, platform, agent/verifier
  image digests, evaluator code, resume state, and resource-related extensions. Model, provider,
  thinking, permission, maximum turns, credential-variable names, and profile extensions must
  also be equal. The only permitted profile differences are explicitly declared prompt,
  compression, and tool-policy version changes; corresponding Agent code may change with them.
- The V1 gate rejects a drop greater than 10 percentage points and unconditionally rejects a
  three-task `3/3 -> 0/3` catastrophe. A waiver requires an explicit reason after comparability
  succeeds. Only `reject && !merged` contributes to `RegressionGateLedger.intercepted_count`.
  Missing tasks, unequal denominators, blocked/offline/invalid reports, or non-official results
  are `invalid`, not a score delta.
- A passed gate is `self_only` until an accepted external calibration both satisfies the five-profile
  threshold and covers the baseline and candidate profile fingerprints. It may then be labelled
  `external_calibrated`; no calibration or a non-covering calibration cannot support a
  generalization claim.
- `PairedExperiment.build` pairs two complete official reports on `(task_id, attempt)` — the
  attempt is the seed dimension under the manifest-level seed/repeats contract, no per-task seed
  mechanism. Comparability before pairing reuses the gate's invariant fields sets: distinct run
  IDs, identical catalog locks, identical manifest/profile invariants, and the actual profile
  variation differences must equal the declared `ChangeKind` set. A broken pair, missing task,
  or non-official result is an `invalid` trial, never a half-built pairing. `PairedTrialOutcome`
  is the five-cell fail→pass / pass→fail / pass→pass / fail→fail / invalid mapping; statistical
  significance (bootstrap / McNemar) is a later layer, not part of the report.
- `HarnessVariant` is the first-class changeable surface of a Harness configuration: prompt,
  compression, and tool-policy versions only. Model, provider, seed, budget, and environment
  invariants are deliberately outside its surface; `from_profile` extracts exactly the three
  changeable fields.
- `ProcessEvidenceProjector` runs inside `TraceRecorder.record`, before sanitization, and emits a
  separate `evidence` array alongside `events` in `harbor-trace.json`; `TraceEvent` schema is
  untouched. Evidence carries only facts plus digests: `tool_call_id`, `tool_phase`,
  `tool_fingerprint` (taken from the argument-carrying start/update phase), `is_error` (from
  `tool_execution_end`), `target_scope` (source / test / verifier / other classified before path
  hashing), `validation_command` booleans matched against the task card's commands before
  hashing, compaction, and termination markers. Full commands, raw paths, and tool outputs are
  never persisted.
- `ProcessVerifier` runs deterministically on every trace, including passed ones, and consumes
  `ProcessEvidence`; it is a separate judging layer that never changes `TaskResult.verdict` and
  does not call `classify_failure`. `ProcessVerification.status` aggregates to `critical_veto`
  when any violation is critical (validation missing / test tampering), else `violation` when any
  rule fires, else `valid`. Traces without evidence (legacy format) degrade explicitly to
  `evidence_unavailable` instead of guessing from redacted text. Rules: `repeated_tool_call`
  (call-level fingerprints, start/update/end lifecycle never counts as repetition),
  `tool_error_not_recovered` (only `is_error=true` end evidence), `validation_missing` (only
  `PASSED` results with non-empty validation commands), `test_tampering` (write tools touching
  test/verifier scope), `premature_termination`, and `context_regression` (first tool call after
  a compaction repeating a pre-compaction failed fingerprint). Thresholds and tool lists are
  constructor parameters. The committed calibration fixtures
  (`tests/benchmarks/fixtures/agent_e2e/calibration/`) pin recall (violations detected) and
  precision (clean traces never vetoed). `ProcessReplayContext` (verdict / stop_reason /
  public_validation_commands) and `verify_case(evidence, *, context, task_id)` enable offline
  replay of a self-contained EvidenceRegressionCase without reconstructing a full
  TaskSpec/TaskResult; `verify` and `verify_case` share the same rule aggregation and the same
  context must yield the same verification. This replay only re-runs the deterministic
  detection rules; it never executes production Harness logic.
- `PairedExperiment` distinguishes three experiment kinds. `CONTROLLED` requires equal
  `agent_code_sha` between baseline and candidate **and verified treatment at run
  granularity**: each side must validate as a single consistent `RunInjectionEvidence`
  (every `task × attempt` carries `InjectionEvidence` whose `requested` matches the
  manifest profile and whose `resolved_variant`/fingerprint are identical across the
  run — one missing or divergent result invalidates the whole run), and **every declared
  `ChangeKind`** must be hit on both sides with different injected content (per-dimension
  `prompt_sha256` / `tool_policy_sha256`). A declared `PROMPT` change is not verified by a
  `tool_policy` hit; the evidence must prove the declared treatment, not merely that some
  injection happened. Its paired deltas may be attributed to the declared mechanism.
  `REGRESSION` allows different agent code and only supports "this version regressed as a
  whole" claims. `UNSUPPORTED_TREATMENT` covers same-code pairs where the variable has no
  runtime switch (e.g. `compression_version`), injection did not resolve (missing maps,
  identical fingerprints, no evidence), or run-level evidence is inconsistent: the report
  must state the delta is not attributable to that mechanism. `compression_version` remains
  a declared field with no runtime switch and must never produce `CONTROLLED`; this
  limitation is recorded in the profile, not hidden.
- `VariantInjectionSpec` travels with the `ExperimentManifest` (its `extensions`
  `variant_injection_spec` key is part of the frozen manifest) from host to the Harbor
  installed-agent, so `worker_entrypoint` resolves and applies the same mapping table on the
  container side. The manifest is the **single source of truth** for the spec:
  `HarborExecutionRequest` does not carry a separate `injection_spec` (no dual source);
  `request_variant=True` only asserts that the manifest carries one. A
  `ToolPolicyVariantMap` must name at least one tool (`tool_names` is non-empty), so a hit
  always means a real registry filter — empty whitelists that claim a hit without injecting
  are rejected at construction. `harbor_agent._SOURCE_FILES` must include every module the
  worker chain imports (`evidence.py`, `variant_injection.py`).
- `ControlledExperimentRunner` is the formal host entry that creates a controlled
  experiment: one shared `VariantInjectionSpec` plus a frozen template and two profiles
  (`build_manifests`) produce the two frozen manifests, and `run_pair` executes both runs
  by reusing the **Verified official chain** (`run_verified_evaluation`: artifact → Harbor
  → SWE-bench Harness), looping every `task × attempt` and handing the assembled reports to
  `PairedExperiment.build`. It does not depend on the foundation
  `SingleTaskOrchestrator`/`ContainerBackend`; there is a single official execution chain.
  The Verified chain forwards `WorkerResult.injection_evidence` into
  `TaskResult.extensions["injection_evidence"]` (via `_merge_worker_result`) and sets
  `request_variant=True` on the Harbor request whenever the manifest carries
  `variant_injection_spec`, so real Harbor runs surface the evidence and the variant
  declaration that `PairedExperiment` consumes. `run_pair` validates the **execution
  context invariant** before running: `commit_sha`, `repository_root`,
  `python_executable`, `harness_python`, and `harbor_executable` must be identical
  between baseline and candidate (manifest comparability alone only constrains the
  declared surface, and `agent_code_sha` is a 7-char prefix match — drifting host inputs
  would otherwise mask fake causality behind identical code + valid evidence). `run_pair`
  derives declared changes from the actual profile version differences, so a run that
  does not change any gate-controlled version fails before execution.
- `comparison.py` turns a `PairedExperimentReport` into a publishable conclusion.
  `OutcomeComparison` consumes the four-grid: `net_improvement = fail→pass − pass→fail`,
  `delta_success_rate = net / valid_pairs`, a McNemar **exact** two-sided p-value on the
  discordant cells, and a deterministic-seed paired-bootstrap percentile CI for the delta.
  The signal is **asymmetric**: regression is caught sensitively by a deterministic
  catastrophe rule (winning discordant cell ≥ `min_discordant` and margin ≥
  `min_discordant`, e.g. `pass→fail=6, fail→pass=1` → REGRESSED) or McNemar `p < alpha`;
  improvement requires **statistical evidence only** — McNemar `p < alpha` with `fail→pass`
  dominating (the bootstrap CI is reported as effect size, never a standalone IMPROVED
  trigger, so tiny samples like `fail→pass=4, pass→fail=0` stay a positive-signal NEUTRAL
  instead of claiming IMPROVED). `p` is never the sole gate criterion for regression
  because small samples make it meaningless.
  `ProcessComparison` consumes `#144`'s `ProcessVerification` supplied by the caller as
  `(task_id, attempt)` maps (the execution chain does **not** persist it on `TaskResult`;
  comparison does not extend the chain). Severity order VALID < VIOLATION < CRITICAL_VETO;
  `EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE` or a missing pair is not comparable. It records new critical
  vetoes / new violations / resolved violations per pair. `EfficiencyComparison` only
  observes mean turns/tokens/cost/wall-time (`AgentRunSummary`; there is no tool-call count
  on `TaskResult` in V1) and raises a guardrail only when outcome and process are not
  degraded: cost ≥ +35% / wall-time ≥ +40% default to WARN, huge thresholds (default
  +200~300%) to BLOCKED. It never claims "fewer tool calls = better".
- `gate.py` applies the fixed `GateV2` priority to a `ComparisonResult`:
  (1) `UNSUPPORTED_TREATMENT` → BLOCKED (not attributable); (2) any new critical process
  veto → BLOCKED; (3) clear outcome regression → REGRESSED; (4) process-not-degraded with
  an efficiency BLOCKED guardrail → BLOCKED (an efficiency catastrophe must not be
  bypassed by outcome improvement); (5) outcome IMPROVED **and process fully comparable**
  (gated, `unavailable == 0`, no regressed pair) → IMPROVED — process missing or partially
  unavailable downgrades to NEUTRAL, because "no degradation observed" is not "not
  tested"; (6) otherwise NEUTRAL, with efficiency WARN recorded but never changing the
  decision. Outcome IMPROVED with process regression → NEUTRAL (fails the "process not
  degraded" precondition). The decision is `GateDecision` ∈
  {IMPROVED, NEUTRAL, REGRESSED, BLOCKED}, wrapped with reasons in `GateV2Result`.
- `first_error.attribute_first_error` locates the first causally meaningful deviation on a
  pair of trajectories (baseline/candidate `ProcessEvidence[]`). It aggregates evidence
  into **call-level** records (fingerprint taken from the first argument-carrying
  start/update phase), aligns by `(tool_name, fingerprint)` common prefix to find the first
  divergence, then promotes it to a first error only when candidate-side failure evidence
  exists. It reuses `ProcessVerifier` on the candidate evidence and picks the strongest
  violation by a fixed priority: critical veto (test tampering) → `PROCESS_VIOLATION`,
  unrecovered tool error → `ERROR_RECOVERY`, validation missing → `VALIDATION`, compaction
  regression → `CONTEXT`, premature termination → `TERMINATION`, behavior divergence →
  `TOOL_SELECTION`/`TOOL_ARGUMENT`/`UNKNOWN`. Confidence is 1.0 for a candidate-only
  violation (0.7 if baseline has the same kind), and a bare divergence without any
  violation only yields a low-confidence candidate (0.6) when baseline PASSES while the
  candidate FAILS — a PASS→PASS divergence is a different implementation path, **not** a
  first error, and returns `None` so harmless tool-selection differences never pollute the
  regression corpus. Evidence aggregation sorts by `sequence`
  before building calls (order-independent), and empty evidence on either side (legacy /
  unavailable trace) returns an explicit `evidence_available=False` attribution with
  confidence 0 instead of fabricating an insertion/deletion divergence. The output carries
  a short redacted causal snippet (`baseline_events`/`candidate_events`; sequence + tool +
  phase + fp-prefix + error/validation/termination markers only — no paths or command
  text, and tool-bearing validation events keep their `validation` marker) that the next
  `regression_probe` layer can minimize.
- `regression_probe.probe_holds` and `regression_probe.minimize_failure_evidence` perform
  deterministic failure-fragment minimization on `ProcessEvidence[]`: the slice loop reuses
  `ProcessVerifier` to test whether the target `ProcessViolationType` still holds, empty
  evidence never counts as a violation, and greedy per-event removal converges to a
  **1-minimal** fragment — removing any single event from the result breaks the violation —
  which is not guaranteed to be globally shortest. Violation-specific
  sufficiency (failed call + same-fingerprint repeat for `TOOL_ERROR_NOT_RECOVERED`; failed
  call + compaction + post-compaction same-fingerprint call for `CONTEXT_REGRESSION`; a single
  write tool touching test/verifier scope for `TEST_TAMPERING`) lives in the verifier rules,
  not in the trimming loop, so the minimizer is not a dumb event-count trimmer.
- `evidence_regression_corpus` is an **Evidence Regression Corpus, not a Harness behavior
  regression corpus**: it turns a `FirstErrorAttribution` into a self-contained
  `EvidenceRegressionCase` only when evidence is available, confidence is exactly 1.0, and
  the candidate evidence actually carries one of the six supported deterministic violations
  (`TEST_TAMPERING`, `TOOL_ERROR_NOT_RECOVERED`, `VALIDATION_MISSING`, `CONTEXT_REGRESSION`,
  `PREMATURE_TERMINATION`, `REPEATED_TOOL_CALL`). Low-confidence (`PASS→FAIL` divergence at
  0.6), unavailable-evidence, and pure-behavior-divergence (`TOOL_SELECTION`/`TOOL_ARGUMENT`/
  `UNKNOWN`) attributions are rejected, and a PASS→PASS divergence never yields an attribution
  in the first place. The case stores structured `ProcessEvidence` (the 1-minimal fragment)
  plus provenance (`source_task_id`/`source_attempt`/`source_run_id`/`first_error_kind`/
  `source_fingerprint`) and a `ProcessReplayContext`; it never stores #149's readable snippet
  strings. `run_evidence_regression_corpus` replays each case offline with `verify_case` and
  emits PASS/FAIL/INVALID per case, aggregated into `EvidenceRegressionCorpusReport` —
  deterministically, same cases in, same report out. Because replaying the same stored
  evidence through the same verifier always yields the same result regardless of Harness
  changes, this corpus only proves "the detection rules still recognize this bad trace"; it
  cannot prove a modified Harness will not reproduce the error, and it must not be marketed as
  a Harness micro-regression gate. A genuine Harness regression case would need a deterministic
  policy entry point in production Harness, which is out of scope for this layer.
- `classify_failure` consumes only redacted `TraceEvent` metadata and emits candidate labels plus
  event sequence offsets. Three consecutive identical tool/argument/workspace fingerprints are
  `loop`; typed context/compaction signals are `context_decay`; a disallowed tool or typed
  tool/permission error is `tool_misuse`; max-turn/cost, abort/cancel, or timeout signals are
  `premature_termination`. A blocked, invalid, or offline result is `infrastructure` and has
  precedence over Agent-behaviour labels.
- Candidate labels are not final attribution. A feedback task can enter the next catalog only after
  `FailureTriage` records reproduction and Agent responsibility, the failure is not deduplicated,
  and the new task has a distinct active `regression` ID. If the source is holdout, it must be put
  in the retired-holdout list and be absent from the next active holdout list. Do not mutate the
  V1 historical corpus in place.
- `TaskVerdict.PASSED` and `FAILED` require `official=True`, `validity=VALID`,
  a patch SHA, and a verifier outcome that agrees with the verdict. Only a
  backend with `supports_official_scores=True` may produce them.
- `FakeContainerBackend`, `UnavailableContainerBackend`, and host fallback can
  produce lifecycle evidence only. They must return `blocked`, `offline_only`,
  or `invalid`, never an official score. Do not store raw session text, tool
  output, or credentials in trace/report artifacts; retain controlled metadata
  and digests instead.

## 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
|---|---|
| Unknown top-level schema field or incompatible version | Pydantic validation error or `SchemaVersionError`; do not coerce it |
| Catalog ID/hash/task selection mismatch | `CatalogValidationError`; do not run the task |
| Corpus has wrong family/split count, missing/private hash mismatch, or unstable evidence | `CorpusAdmissionError`; reject admission |
| Feedback-derived task is in holdout, or base/gold commit occurs across splits | `CorpusAdmissionError`; preserve the original holdout boundary |
| Historical commit is unavailable or its recomputed patch hash differs | `CorpusAdmissionError`; report blocked provenance rather than inventing gold evidence |
| External manifest has not exactly 20 unique IDs, five per stratum, or unique repositories | `ExternalAnchorError`; reject before evaluator execution |
| Docker daemon or frozen official evaluator checkout unavailable | external `blocked` report and blocked `TaskResult`s; no external success rate |
| Local materialized JSONL is absent, not exactly 20 frozen IDs, or its canonical full-row SHA differs | `ExternalAnchorDriftError`; do not invoke the official evaluator against a mutable dataset name |
| A gold preflight record is false, incomplete, missing, or errors | exclude that instance from the actual denominator; do not call it a model failure |
| Official model evaluator omits a stable ID, lacks a boolean `resolved`, or cannot resolve its image digest | external `invalid` report; no external success rate |
| Dataset revision/file, evaluator revision, platform, selected IDs, or image digest differs | `ExternalAnchorDriftError`; reject baseline comparison/calibration |
| Fewer than five calibration profiles, no degraded profile, or constant rank vector | `ExternalAnchorError` or non-accepted calibration; do not claim external validity |
| Gate catalog/profile/resource invariants, frozen task/repeat coverage, or official denominators differ | `GateStatus.INVALID`; do not compute delta or count an interception |
| Candidate falls below the V1 non-inferiority bound or changes `3/3` to `0/3` | `GateStatus.REJECT`; add one ledger interception only if it remains unmerged |
| Candidate is comparable but needs an approved exception | `GateStatus.WAIVED` with a non-empty waiver reason |
| Trace has a loop/context/tool/premature candidate | `FailureRecord` with only redacted metadata, stable signature, and evidence offsets; require human triage |
| Blocked, invalid, or offline task is classified | `FailureMode.INFRASTRUCTURE`; do not attribute it to the Agent |
| A reproduced Agent failure originated from holdout | retire the source ID before admitting a distinct regression feedback task |
| Docker/backend unavailable | `TaskResult(verdict=blocked, validity=blocked, official=False)` |
| Fake backend completes worker/verifier lifecycle | `TaskResult(verdict=blocked, validity=offline_only, official=False)` |
| Agent/verifier workspaces overlap or private assets are visible | `TaskResult(verdict=invalid, validity=invalid, official=False)` before worker execution |
| Worker timeout/error, verifier error, or cleanup failure | `TaskResult(verdict=invalid, validity=invalid, official=False)` and one cleanup attempt |
| Checkpoint exists for same run/task/attempt | Return the recorded result with `resumed_from_checkpoint=True`; do not rerun backend |

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: a real backend mounts an Agent worktree and a separate verifier worktree,
  sends only the patch digest across the boundary, and marks a verified pass as
  official.
- Base: the current offline command validates a frozen manifest and emits one
  blocked report without reading credentials, starting Docker, or claiming a
  success rate.
- Good: the historical corpus sends one task's public card to an isolated base
  snapshot, while `PrivateEvidence` checks its gold revision on the evaluator
  host.
- Base: a three-run Git provenance check proves a patch source is reproducible,
  then records `fail/pass` only as provenance evidence.
- Bad: treating two paths as isolated merely because their strings differ. A
  verifier directory inside the Agent workspace is still visible to the Agent.
- Bad: using a host worktree plus `bypassPermissions` as an official run; the
  Agent can access paths outside the worktree and the verifier assets are not
  protected by a container boundary.
- Bad: copying the full historical catalog or `.git` object store into the
  Agent workspace; an adjacent task's public base can reveal another task's
  gold commit.
- Good: the host runs `gold` three times through the official SWE-bench-Live evaluator,
  drops one unstable instance from the denominator, and reports `passed / stable_count` only
  after every remaining official report has an image digest.
- Bad: treating a Docker-less fake result as an external failure/pass rate, keeping the raw
  prediction patch in a report, or comparing results after the evaluator image changed.
- Good: a declared prompt-version candidate replays every frozen task and repeat under the same
  evaluator, resources, images, model, and permissions; its complete official score stays within
  the non-inferiority boundary before merge.
- Bad: changing the model or task selection while claiming a prompt-only gate pass, or writing a
  delta from blocked/offline results. Both are `invalid`, not successful experimentation.
- Good: a repeated `read_file` call with identical argument and workspace digests is classified as
  a loop candidate, then a reviewer reproduces it and records Agent responsibility before adding
  a new regression task.
- Bad: copying a holdout failure into regression while leaving the source task active in holdout,
  or automatically treating a timeout/invalid verifier as an Agent failure.

## 6. Tests Required

- `tests/benchmarks/test_models_catalog.py`: version round-trip, unknown fields,
  catalog/lock mismatches, and official verdict/score consistency.
- `tests/benchmarks/test_orchestrator.py`: unavailable/fake backend, worker and
  verifier errors, cleanup, checkpoint resume, equal/nested workspace rejection.
- `tests/benchmarks/test_agent_worker.py`: real `Agent` worker captures Core
  output and keeps the JSONL session outside the task workspace.
- `tests/benchmarks/test_trace.py`: secret/path/session/prompt redaction and loop
  fingerprint evidence.
- `tests/benchmarks/test_evaluation_cli.py`: the online command remains explicitly blocked
  and never emits `task_resolved`.
- `tests/benchmarks/test_corpus.py`: thirty-card quotas, public/private asset
  correspondence, feedback/holdout and commit-chain rejection, plus three-run
  provenance evidence for every bundled task.
- `tests/benchmarks/test_external_anchor.py`: frozen 20-card stratification and fingerprint,
  offline blocked behavior, three-run gold denominator, official result normalization,
  missing image invalidation, prediction-ID boundary, artifact redaction, environment drift,
  and five-profile calibration thresholds.
- `tests/benchmarks/test_regression_feedback.py`: pass/reject/invalid/waived decisions,
  deliberate `3/3 -> 0/3` ledger interception, self-only scope, four trace failure rules,
  infrastructure priority, signature deduplication, and reviewed holdout-to-regression retirement.
- `tests/benchmarks/test_regression_probe.py`: probe holds on unrecovered error / context
  regression / test tampering, empty-evidence false, long-trace trimming to a 1-minimal
  fragment, single-event-removal minimality, initial-slice misuse, and the injected-probe loop.
- `tests/benchmarks/test_evidence_regression_corpus.py`: admission rejections (low confidence /
  unavailable evidence / no deterministic violation), PASS→PASS never entering the corpus,
  full-flow minimization provenance, `REPEATED_TOOL_CALL` admission despite `UNKNOWN` kind,
  JSON round-trip, and runner PASS/FAIL/INVALID with same-input determinism.
- Before handoff run focused evaluation tests, `python -m pytest -q`,
  `python -m compileall -q lion_code benchmarks tests`, and `git diff --check`.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

### Wrong

```python
# A Git worktree is not a security boundary.
backend = HostShellBackend(worktree=agent_workspace)
result = TaskResult(
    verdict=TaskVerdict.PASSED,
    validity=ResultValidity.VALID,
    official=True,
)
```

### Correct

```python
isolation = await backend.inspect_isolation(
    request,
    verifier_workspace=verifier_workspace,
)
if not isolation.official_safe:
    return invalid_result("Agent/verifier isolation contract failed")

worker = await backend.run_agent(request)
verifier = await backend.run_verifier(verifier_request)
# Only a real container backend with supports_official_scores=True may write
# passed/failed after the verifier outcome is available.
```

### Wrong

```python
# This publishes an implementation clue and treats provenance as a score.
agent_workspace = source_repository_worktree
report.official_score = score_from_historical_patch_hashes()
```

### Correct

```python
public_card = select_one_public_task(task_id)
base_snapshot = export_base_tree(public_card.base_revision)
provenance = run_historical_preflight(public_card, private_evidence, repo_root)
assert provenance.stable
# Keep the report offline until an isolated semantic verifier runs.
```

### Wrong

```python
# A current Hugging Face row order and a Docker tag are not a frozen external baseline.
external_rate = fake_runner.score(live_dataset.sample(20))
```

### Correct

```python
gold = run_gold_preflight(manifest, runner=official_runner, output_root=host_results)
assert gold.status is AnchorRunStatus.COMPLETED
report = run_external_anchor_evaluation(
    manifest,
    runner=official_runner,
    prediction_path=prediction_json,
    output_root=host_results,
)
if report.status is AnchorRunStatus.COMPLETED:
    require_comparable_external_reports(baseline, report)
```

### Wrong

```python
# Offline evidence is not an eligible gate score, and this silently leaks a holdout sample.
candidate_rate = blocked_report.extensions["estimated_rate"]
next_catalog.tasks += [holdout_failure_as_regression]
```

### Correct

```python
decision = evaluate_regression_gate(
    baseline_report,
    candidate_report,
    declared_changes=(ChangeKind.PROMPT,),
)
if decision.gate.status is GateStatus.REJECT:

    retired_holdout_task_ids=(holdout_task.task_id,),
)
assert holdout_task.task_id not in admission.active_holdout_task_ids_after_feedback
```

## 8. Verified SWE-bench Execution Chain

### 1. Scope / Trigger

This contract applies to the single-task `verified-run` path that turns one
selected Git commit into a Harbor routine trial and then rechecks the exact
exported patch with the official SWE-bench Harness. It is an integration
boundary: the benchmark runner may orchestrate existing Lion worker behavior,
but it must not implement a second Agent execution loop or verifier.

### 2. Signatures

```python
class CommitArtifactBuilder:
    def build(self, commit_sha: str, output_dir: str | Path) -> CommitArtifact: ...

class HarborSingleTaskRunner:
    def run(self, request: HarborExecutionRequest) -> HarborExecutionOutput: ...

class OfficialSWEbenchHarnessRunner:
    def run(self, request: HarnessExecutionRequest) -> HarnessExecutionOutput: ...

def run_verified_evaluation(
    request: VerifiedExecutionRequest,
) -> VerifiedExecutionOutput: ...
```

The CLI entrypoint is `python -m benchmarks.agent_e2e verified-run`. It accepts
one catalog-selected task and one commit, and writes `verified-report.json`
and `verified-report.md` under the caller-provided output directory.

### 3. Contracts

- The execution order is exactly `CommitArtifactBuilder -> HarborSingleTaskRunner -> OfficialSWEbenchHarnessRunner`.
- `CommitArtifactBuilder` reads a resolved Git commit through `git archive`; a
  dirty host worktree, host `.git` directory, and untracked files are not part
  of the artifact. The wheel digest and Git tree SHA are persisted as
  provenance, and repeated builds of the same commit are byte-stable.
- Harbor is pinned to `0.22.0`, uses dataset `swebench-verified`, exactly one
  task/attempt/concurrent worker, and the fixed import path
  `benchmarks.agent_e2e.harbor_agent:LionInstalledAgent`.
- The installed agent uploads only the wheel, the allowlisted worker source,
  and the request; it invokes the existing `run_agent_worker` entrypoint. The
  manifest carries credential variable names, never credential values. Values
  are not placed in argv, JSON reports, traces, or exception summaries.
- The official recheck is SWE-bench `5.0.1`, dataset
  `SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Verified`, split `test`, and module
  `swebench.harness.run_evaluation`. It receives the exact UTF-8 patch bytes
  exported by Harbor and verifies their SHA-256 before writing prediction
  JSONL.
- Harbor reward is routine evidence only. A `PASSED`/`FAILED` official result
  may be produced only after the official Harness result is completed and the
  backend declares `supports_official_scores=True`.
- Raw Harbor/Harness job roots are deleted on success, timeout, ordinary
  errors, and unexpected failures. A cleanup failure is an invalid,
  non-official result and must not be silently ignored. Only controlled
  digests, patch, worker, trace, and final report artifacts remain.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
|---|---|
| Selected task is absent from the manifest or repeats is not `1` | Reject before backend execution; no official result |
| Commit cannot be resolved, wheel build fails, or artifact commit differs from `agent_code_sha` | `blocked` or `invalid` non-official report |
| Platform is not Linux, Harbor is unavailable/not `0.22.0`, or Docker daemon is unavailable | Harbor `unavailable`/`blocked`; do not invoke official Harness |
| Dataset, agent import path, task name, run ID, or model path contains an unsupported value | Invalid schema/path result; do not create an evaluator run |
| Required provider credential variable is missing | Harbor unavailable; do not expose the missing value in the result |
| Harbor has no controlled patch or patch digest | Blocked/non-official result; do not invoke official Harness |
| SWE-bench package is not `5.0.1`, image digest is absent, or Docker is unavailable | Harness unavailable/invalid; no official score |
| Harness report is missing, malformed, or lacks boolean `resolved` | Invalid/non-official result |
| Any raw-job cleanup fails | Invalid result with `failure_source=CLEANUP`; retain no claim of completion |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: build a wheel from the selected commit, run one isolated Harbor
  installed-agent trial, copy only its patch and controlled metadata, and pass
  that patch unchanged to the pinned official Harness.
- Base: on Windows or without credentials/Docker, stop at an explicit blocked
  report with fixed dependency provenance; this is lifecycle evidence, not an
  evaluation score.
- Bad: build from the current dirty worktree, pass a host absolute path or
  secret in Harbor argv, or treat Harbor's reward as SWE-bench `resolved`.
- Bad: run the Harness against a newly generated patch, a mutable dataset
  default, or a leftover raw job directory; those results are not comparable
  official evidence.

### 6. Tests Required

- `tests/benchmarks/test_verified_execution_chain.py`: stable Git artifact
  digest, dirty/untracked-file exclusion, patch export redaction, fixed Harbor
  argv, raw-result normalization, prediction-byte verification, cleanup,
  path validation, and the artifact-before-backend ordering.
- Existing worker/contract/CLI tests must continue to pass, including the
  assertion that `online-run` remains blocked and no fake backend can produce
  an official verdict.
- On a Linux Docker host, run one real `verified-run` smoke with Harbor
  `0.22.0` and SWE-bench `5.0.1`; assert that the Harbor-exported patch SHA,
  Harness prediction patch SHA, report revisions, image digest, and final
  cleanup state agree.
- Before handoff run targeted evaluation tests, full pytest, compileall, the
  repository quality gates, and `git diff --check`; record unrelated baseline
  failures separately from this chain.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```python
# Harbor reward is not the official SWE-bench verifier result.
result = TaskResult(verdict=TaskVerdict.PASSED, official=True)
```

#### Correct

```python
harbor = HarborSingleTaskRunner().run(harbor_request)
if harbor.patch_path is None:
    return blocked_nonofficial_result(harbor.result)

harness = OfficialSWEbenchHarnessRunner().run(
    HarnessExecutionRequest(
        instance_id=instance_id,
        patch_path=harbor.patch_path,
        patch_sha256=harbor.result.patch_sha256,
        model_name=manifest.profile.model,
        run_id=manifest.run_id,
        output_dir=output_dir,
        timeout_seconds=manifest.timeout_seconds,
        image_digest=manifest.verifier_image_digest,
    )
)
return harness_result_to_task_result(
    harness.result,
    manifest=manifest,
    attempt=1,
    supports_official_scores=True,
)
```
## 9. Offline DeepEval Analysis and Opik Post-Processing

### 1. Scope / Trigger

This contract applies when a completed Verified report is analyzed after the
Agent run. It is a benchmark-only integration boundary: analysis and
observability consume existing redacted evidence and never become a second
execution or scoring path.

### 2. Signatures

```python
def analyze_deepeval_case(
    case: DeepEvalAnalysisCase,
    *,
    judge_model: str,
    judge: DeepEvalJudge | None = None,
    timeout_seconds: float | None = 120.0,
) -> DeepEvalAnalysis: ...

def analyze_verified_report(
    report: VerifiedEvaluationReport,
    *,
    input_digest: str,
    analysis_trace: AnalysisTrace | None = None,
    judge_model: str,
    judge: DeepEvalJudge | None = None,
    timeout_seconds: float | None = 120.0,
) -> VerifiedEvaluationReport: ...

def build_opik_trace_payload(...) -> OpikTracePayload: ...

def publish_opik_trace(
    payload: OpikTracePayload,
    *,
    client: object | None = None,
    timeout_seconds: float = 30.0,
    export_attempt: int = 1,
) -> OpikExportResult: ...
```

### 3. Contracts

- DeepEval evaluates exactly the fixed metrics `ArgumentCorrectnessMetric` and
  `ToolDecisionQuality`; the SDK is optional and pinned in the
  `benchmark-online` extra, never imported by `lion_code`.
- The worker projects typed Core tool events into one bounded, versioned
  `AnalysisTrace`. The DeepEval adapter consumes only a schema- and digest-
  validated `AnalysisTrace`; the legacy digest-only `DeepEvalTrajectory`
  remains an independent input for existing process/Opik observability and is
  never reverse-projected into semantic tool arguments.
- Analysis Trace collection is best-effort sidecar work. The projector freezes
  itself after an exception, and construction, digest-validation, or write
  failures may only omit `analysis-trace.json`; they must not escape the event
  listener or worker entrypoint, alter `WorkerResult`, `trace.json`, or the
  patch, or affect Harbor/Harness. A missing artifact follows the existing
  typed DeepEval unavailable path.
- The project analyzer and the optional standard pytest entry consume the same
  public task context and ordered Analysis Trace. They must not call the Agent,
  generate a new dataset, or use hidden reasoning, credentials, raw tool
  output, or private verifier data.
- Each metric observation carries the same input digest as the case. A score
  is persisted only when it is finite and in `[0, 1]`; a single failure or
  timeout is typed and does not discard successful sibling metrics.
- `DeepEvalAnalysis` keeps the two metric results independent: each result's
  score, reason, status, sampling metadata, model, threshold metadata, and input
  digest remain separately observable. It does not compute or persist an
  aggregate pass/fail score conclusion; these metrics are advisory and cannot
  change the official Harness result or the CLI exit code.
- A Judge reason containing `[seq=N]` preserves that supplied reference. When
  no sequence is supplied, the adapter appends the bounded note
  `（Judge 未提供 sequence 定位）` and never invents a reference to the first
  Analysis Trace event.
- `analyze_verified_report` may update only the `deepeval` field. The existing
  `task_result` and its official Harness verdict remain unchanged.
- Opik payloads contain a parent agent span, redacted event spans with stable
  timestamps/digests, and feedback for completed DeepEval metrics plus the
  Harness verdict. `PASSED`/`FAILED` feedback is emitted only for an official,
  valid result; blocked/offline results remain metadata/reason only.
- Opik credentials are read only by the host publisher from environment
  variables. The publisher explicitly flushes the short-lived client, and a
  retry reuses the existing payload without rerunning Agent or DeepEval.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
|---|---|
| Analysis Trace/report task or trace IDs, or its digest, do not match | Reject before analysis/export; preserve the original report |
| Analysis Trace projection, construction, digest validation, or write fails | Omit only `analysis-trace.json`; preserve worker result, formal trace, patch, Harbor, and Harness, then report DeepEval unavailable |
| Analysis Trace is missing, out of scope, or invalid | Return typed `DeepEvalAnalysisStatus.UNAVAILABLE`; never reconstruct it from a legacy digest-only trajectory |
| DeepEval SDK is absent or its pinned API is incompatible | `DeepEvalAnalysisStatus.UNAVAILABLE`; no official verdict change |
| One metric fails, times out, or returns an invalid score | Typed metric failure; retain other scores and mark the analysis status partial/timeout/failed |
| Metric input digest differs from the case digest | Invalid metric observation; do not persist its score |
| Analysis Trace contains unbounded or sensitive text | Reject the semantic artifact; never publish the raw value |
| Opik host credentials or SDK are unavailable | `OpikExportStatus.UNAVAILABLE`; no Agent/Harness rerun |
| Opik flush or network export fails | Typed timeout/failed result with the same payload digest; allow retry |
| Task result is blocked/offline/non-official | Do not emit a numeric Harness feedback score |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: load one frozen Verified report and validated Analysis Trace, calculate
  the two metrics through the shared analyzer, then publish the existing
  redacted trajectory as a post-run Opik tree.
- Base: on Windows, without optional credentials, or without Analysis Trace,
  record typed unavailable analysis/export state while retaining the
  deterministic official result.
- Bad: rerun the Agent for DeepEval, let a judge decide pass/fail, or publish
  raw prompts, tool output, paths, hidden reasoning, or credentials.
- Bad: treat an Opik upload failure as a Harness failure or retry by executing
  the benchmark again instead of reusing the payload.

### 6. Tests Required

- `tests/benchmarks/test_eval_analysis_observability.py`: fixed two metrics and
  shared digest, partial failure, timeout, verdict immutability, span tree,
  timestamps, feedback, redaction, flush, and retry.
- `tests/benchmarks/evals/test_lion_swebench_verified.py`: standard pytest
  composition over precomputed Analysis Trace/report; assert the two metric
  names, completed analysis, and unchanged `task_result`.
- On a Linux host with the pinned optional dependencies and credentials, run
  one existing Verified result through DeepEval and Opik, then verify the
  `run_id` trace, two metric feedback entries, Harness metadata, and flush
  state. This smoke is separate from offline CI tests.
- Before handoff run the targeted benchmark tests, targeted lint/compile
  checks, and `git diff --check`; do not use unavailable optional services as
  a reason to invent a score.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```python
# Analysis must not replace the official result or rerun the Agent.
report.task_result = judge_agent_again(case)
publish_raw_trajectory_to_opik(report)
```

#### Correct

```python
analyzed = analyze_verified_report(
    report,
    input_digest=input_digest,
    analysis_trace=analysis_trace,
    judge_model=judge_model,
)
payload = build_opik_trace_payload(
    run_id=analyzed.manifest.run_id,
    task_id=analyzed.task_result.task_id,
    attempt=analyzed.task_result.attempt,
    commit_sha=analyzed.manifest.agent_code_sha,
    profile_fingerprint=analyzed.manifest.profile_fingerprint,
    trajectory=trajectory,
    analysis=analyzed.deepeval,
    task_result=analyzed.task_result,
)
export = publish_opik_trace(payload)
assert analyzed.task_result == report.task_result
```

## 10. Verified Composition CLI

### 1. Scope / Trigger

This contract applies to the single-run composition added on top of Sections 8
and 9. It owns only argument parsing, stage ordering, report writing, and exit
codes; it must not add another Agent loop, scorer, or publisher.

### 2. Signatures

```python
def run_verified_evaluation(
    request: VerifiedExecutionRequest,
) -> VerifiedExecutionOutput: ...

def verified_exit_code(report: VerifiedEvaluationReport) -> int: ...
```

The command is `python -m benchmarks.agent_e2e verified-run` with required
`--catalog`, `--manifest`, `--task-id`, and `--commit`; `--run-id` is optional
but, when supplied, must equal `manifest.run_id`.

### 3. Contracts

- A run has one catalog task and one output directory. The fixed order is
  `artifact -> Harbor -> Harness -> DeepEval -> Opik`; later stages consume
  typed results or controlled artifacts from earlier stages.
- The DeepEval input digest is the SHA-256 of the public prompt sent to the
  worker. Harbor transports `analysis-trace.json` as a bounded, validated
  semantic input for DeepEval; the legacy `harbor-trace.json` trajectory stays
  on the existing process/Opik path. No stage invokes the Agent a second time.
- Harness may return the external SWE-bench instance ID; the composition maps
  it back to the selected catalog task ID before building `TaskResult`.
- `verified-report.json` and `verified-report.md` are always written when a
  report exists. DeepEval or Opik failures update only their own typed fields;
  they never replace an official Harness result.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
|---|---|
| Task is not selected, repeats is not `1`, digest/timeout is invalid, or `--run-id` mismatches | Reject before backend execution; no official result |
| Artifact/Harbor fails or Harbor exports no patch | Blocked/non-official report; do not invoke Harness, and never emit an official score |
| Harness returns an unknown task ID or malformed official result | Invalid/non-official report |
| No controlled Analysis Trace is available | Retain the Harbor/Harness report; mark DeepEval unavailable and do not reverse the legacy digest |
| No legacy controlled trajectory is available | Retain the report; do not publish an Opik event tree |
| DeepEval or Opik fails after official scoring | Typed failure in that stage; preserve the official task result |
| Trial is subject-failed, infra-failed, indeterminate, or an official task fails | Exit `1`, `2`, `3`, or `1` respectively; completed official pass exits `0` |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: invoke the shared function once, pass the exact Harbor patch to
  Harness, analyze the validated Analysis Trace, and write both report forms.
- Base: on Windows, without Analysis Trace, or without an optional service,
  record blocked or unavailable stage state without inventing a score.
- Bad: rerun the Agent for DeepEval, use Harbor reward as an official verdict,
  or turn an infrastructure failure into a zero score.

### 6. Tests Required

- `tests/benchmarks/test_verified_cli_composition.py` must assert stage order,
  public-prompt digest, task-ID normalization, fixed report paths, stable exit
  codes, redaction, and preservation of the official result when post-processing
  fails.
- Existing Verified execution, analysis, and CLI tests must continue to pass;
  the real Linux smoke is a separate single-task acceptance check.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```python
# Judge output is not an official SWE-bench result.
report.task_result = judge_result_to_task_result(judge_output)
```

#### Correct

```python
execution = run_verified_evaluation(request)
assert execution.report.task_result == official_task_result
json_path, markdown_path = write_verified_report(execution.report, output_dir)
```
